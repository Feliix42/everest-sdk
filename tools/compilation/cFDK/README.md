cFDK
==========
The **IBM cloudFPGA Development Kit (cFDK)**.

The cFDK is required to integrate applications for the network-attached disaggregated FPGA platform IBM cloudFPGA.

It is used automatically by other EVEREST tools, e.g. DOSA, but could also be used stand alone.

For more information please refer to the following sources:
